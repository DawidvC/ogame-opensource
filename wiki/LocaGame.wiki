#summary Game Locals

Original game load all loca's at every page access (they had 'english.php', 'deutch.php' and so on).
But actually you don't need it all at same time, only some of them (except very important ones)

If game engine cannot find some LOCA, it just echo "LOCA_NAME", instead its value.
So you can easily spot untranslated parts around the game.
